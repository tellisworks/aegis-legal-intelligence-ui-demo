🎯 DEMO INSTRUCTIONS – Aegis Legal Intelligence (UI-Only Mock)

This is a non-functional UI demo for Aegis Legal Intelligence, designed to simulate the final user experience. The backend does not need to perform real analysis. All results should be mocked using static files. The goal is to create a beautiful, clickable interface for demo video purposes.

📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE:
/main.py                        ← optional FastAPI stub
/templates/index.html          ← main UI page
/static/css/style.css          ← styling for all pages
/static/img/                   ← icons (brain, timeline, etc.)
/mock_outputs/                 ← folder for fake JSON/text used for analysis output

🧪 MOCK DATA FILES (use static JSON):
/mock_outputs/contradictions.json  
/mock_outputs/misconduct.json  
/mock_outputs/alienation.json  
/mock_outputs/timeline.json  
/mock_outputs/report.html

✅ GOAL:
Create a stunning, interactive interface that simulates the full Aegis Legal Intelligence system. It must demonstrate uploads, AI-driven findings, timelines, and court-ready output. No real NLP or processing is required. This is a high-fidelity demo for presentations and investor/legal audiences.

DO NOT add real model logic or document parsing. Just show the intended behavior and fake outputs.
